							<p style="color: cadetblue;">	You must have either scorned at the board normalization process, or given blessings to it if your board result was brilliant. Any which ways, if you are reading this page, you are most certainly a student of DTU. 
							Delhi Technological University, formerly known as Delhi College of Engineering, is one of the premier engineering institutes in India. Featured at number 9 in the India Today 2014 survey, DTU has acquired and sustained a reputable position right after the IITs. 
							From being Delhi Polytechnic at Kashmere Gate in 1941 to being Delhi Technological University at Rohini, we have come a long way. 
							The academic excellence of DTU is evident from the extraordinary placements that students of DTU get. Students from DTU have taken placements in renowned companies like Epic, Google, Goldman sachs to name a few.
							The alumni are the strengthening pillars of any institute. Delhi Technological University, erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering has a very strong alumni base. Mr. Vinod Dham, popularly known as the father of the Pentium chip, Mr. Ravi Grover, director of the Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mr Amit Singh - President, Google Enterprise are just some of our notable alumni. 
							There would not be even a single soul who hasn’t heard the famous saying “All work and no play makes jack a dull boy!” And well we are no jacks. Because there are an ample number of cultural and technical societies in our college promoting overall personality development of the students. From the dance and dramatics society to the robotics society, we have it all! 
							So, join societies and make the most of your college life! =)

						<p style="color: cadetblue;"> CSI stands for Computer Society of India, a non-profit organisation which came about in the year 1965. 
						The vast presence of CSI is evident from the fact that it is currently present in 62 different locations and 30,000 members including students like us, software developers, scientists etc. 
						What you just read, did it sound like something that a 20 year old developer would write? Or something that is an apposite description for a college level society? Obviously, no. 
						College life is synonymous with zeal, passion, enthusiasm and excitement. And that is what sets CSI apart from the other clichéd technical societies. 
						We don’t conduct boring meetings, we don’t organise boring events, and dull is one word you’d never associate with us. Because CSI does everything with élan and exuberance. 
						With our well-thought line up of engaging and entertaining events, months are different in college. Too much happens. Every month seems like six regular months when you are a CSI member.
						We want you to be more than just computer literate. We want you to be a computer fanatic. And we fulfil this mission by organizing various IDGs i.e. Interest Development Groups where learning a new language or a new software is made interesting
						With our round-the-year fests and events, we ensure a healthy competition between various passionate students and provide them the right platform to test their skills. 
						But is CSI all about computers and computer learning? Well, NO. CSI presents you with a perfect gamut of both technical as well as non-technical events. So, while Avantgarde may have more of technical events, Hasta la Vista will surprise you with the most exceptional non-technical fun events. 
						What is Hasta la Vista and Avantgarde, you may ask! Well, the entire website has extremely descriptive pages talking about our various fests and events. For your aid, we have added pictures as well as videos to give you a overview of what life at college being a CSI member would be.
						So, browse through the website, and get a good idea about CSI before you make an informed choice of joining us. Happy browsing =)
