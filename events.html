										Did you just see the huge crowd at the PR desk, near Amul? Well, that’s us. CSI. And the event we’re talking about here is THE treasure hunt! Not just any treasure hunt, but CSI’s treasure hunt. The very first event that CSI organises. CSI is always associated with everything technical, but well, the treasure hunt is not a technical event. Instead, it’s a completely non-tech event, in which students from all branches can participate. Consisting of 7-8 levels, this group event is conducted in a time span of 2-3 hours depending on how fast you decipher the clues and reach the treasure. 
										This event is strategically placed in the first few days of August, because this is inevitably the best way to get to know your campus. Running around the college, looking for all sorts of clues, reaching the wrong places, finding the new places, well this is all that happens at the treasure hunt. So, we assure you that by the end of this event, you will know which road in the college is known as what, which canteen is where, and the nice secret locations of the college too ;)

									Its 1PM, and your teacher is teaching you AP-AC and suddenly, this one senior peeps through the class door and asks, “Sir can I speak to the class for 2 min! Sir, it won’t take long, just 2 min?” Experienced that already? Well, those are your second years, who will come to your class introducing their respective societies to you. Telling you how they are better, how they carry out the most exclusive range of events and much more about their societies. We would be doing (if haven’t done already) the same. But more than the class to class society-introduction, we urge you to attend the orientation. CSI orientation is a 1-1.5 hour event, held after college hours for everyone interested in joining our society. Aimed at providing you all the essential details about our society, this event, organised by the second years, is a must-attend event. We provide you a brief account of everything that wheight: 144px;e do throughout the year. And don’t worry; it is not one of those conventional boring orientations that you think it’d be. Being your seniors, we highly recommend you to attend the orientation. Not just CSI orientation, but the orientation of any society that you wish to join. Hope to see you there then =)

									It's that time of the year again, when college just opened for you after your one month long winter break and you think  you have absolutely no work till March when the dreaded mid sems arrive. Well, how about participating in the much anticipated technical fests? Different societies in the college organize different  technical fests. So, don't be surprised if you walk around mechanical canteen and are greeted with music from 3 different camps, each organizing their own fests. The technical fest of CSI is known as PHOENIX. And as the legend goes, when the phoenix resurrects from the ashes, she is even more beautiful than before. In keeping with this famous saying, every year, PHOENIX is even more splendid, captivating and exquisite.
									Phoenix boasts of both online as well as offline events. So, where there is an online photography contest, there is a coding competition too. Where we judge you on your debating skills, we also judge your mathematics skills. And with prizes as big as hp printers and intex speakers, who doesnt wanna put their best foot forward?
									CSI allows you to participate as well as organise events. So, while you collect registrations for cranium being the organiser, you could simultaneously participate in mathrix and hone your math skills. 
									And who says you just have to participate in our events? How about taking a round of the whole campus and participating in every event which interests you? And just so you guys know, during this time, the entire college is on an official mass bunk! Already have goosebumps thinking about what February would be like? Well, imagine how amazing it would be to be a part of all of this! =)

									 This is a techno-management event organised by CSI sometime after your mid sems. This event is the first event, where you as first years would be part of the event, both as organisers as well as participants. From coding events, to LAN gaming to quizzing to debating, you name it and we have it. Aimed at making you compete with others who share the same passion, this fest is a great way to start building your CVs. This 3-4 day event not only includes various competitions, but also includes various workshops. Last year, we had workshops on augmented reality, game theory and machine learning, each of which is an important as well as interesting field of study. 
									 And, well, who doesn’t like prizes and certificates! So gear yourself for this one week of technical as well as non-technical extravaganza!

									This is the one fest that, you, first years will especially like. Because the complete responsibility for this fest is on the first years. You conceive the events, you plan them, you organise them and you conduct them. The complete onus is on you. And the events here are absolutely non-technical. Held around the last week of April, hasta la vista aka fuchcha week, had events like game-o-droid (students had to compete in android games like fruit ninja, 2048 etc), pixelf (best selfie out of the many entries we received was chosen as the winner), know your campus (quiz on the various locations in campus) was held, among others! 
									So brace yourself to organise this entire week of creativity and enthusiasm.
